features:
    - dynamically updated statBoxes for pets
    - save and load pets from local storage
    -set delay on creation of pet so animations are out of sync
bugs:
    -fruitBox styling 
    -dynamically created pets have no interactvity

refactoring:
    - figure out better way to connect pet objects to dom elements 
        - perhaps by using mvc objects? 
    - better way to organize code
